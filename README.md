## Prerequisites

1. Github Runner assigned to the project. A runner needs to be running Ubuntu and has Docker installed. You can learn about self-hosted runners [here](#how-to-setup-a-self-hosted-github-runner).
2. Link to Openwrt SDK `.tar.xz` file.
3. Dockerhub Account

---

## Link Dockerhub account with the repository

1. Open [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/), go to `Account Settings` -> `Security` -> `New Access Token`.
2. Go to Github Repository setting -> `Actions secrets and variables`. Add the following two secrets:

    | File                       | Description                                         |
    | :------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` | Username of your Dockerhub account.        |
    | `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` | Access token generated from your Dockerhub account.        |

3. Done.

## How to dockerised your SDK?

1. Open `Dockerfile` and change `SDK_URL` to you SDK file link.
2. Change `SDK_NAME` to your file name.
3. Change the following env variables to match your Imagebuilder details:

            ENV \
            OPENWRT_ARCH="${OPENWRT_ARCH:-YOUR_ARCHITECTURE}" \
            OPENWRT_GCC="${OPENWRT_GCC:-YOUR_GCC}" \
            OPENWRT_HOST="${OPENWRT_HOST:-YOUR_HOST}" \
            OPENWRT_TARGET="${OPENWRT_TARGET:-YOUR_TARGET}" \
            OPENWRT_SUBTARGET="${OPENWRT_SUBTARGET:-YOUR_SUBTARGET}" \
            OPENWRT_VERSION="${OPENWRT_VERSION:-YOUR_VERSION}"

4. Go to `.github/workflows/main.yml` file and change the following name to your intended docker image name:


            - run: sudo docker image build --file=Dockerfile --pull --tag=${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}/YOUR_DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME:YOUR_DOCKER_TAG .
            - run: sudo docker push "${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}/YOUR_DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME:YOUR_DOCKER_TAG"

## How to setup a self-hosted Github runner?

To create a self-hosted runner for this project we need to have a Ubuntu running instance with [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository). AWS EC2 instance recommended.

1. Go to the Github repository setting -> `Actions` -> `Runners` -> `New self-hosted runner`.
2. Follow the steps for `Linux`
3. In your Ubuntu instance terminal, run `sudo ./svc.sh install`
4. Give access to docker, run `sudo usermod -a -G docker <GITHUB_RUNNER_USER>`
5. Run `sudo ./svc.sh start`
